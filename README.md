# Starlight: Clean starter site evaluation

This demo branch begins by deleting everything in the main branch and starting from a blank slate. It is designed to showcase what we can do, starting with nothing, as quickly as possible, without any pre-existing data or configurations. We will leverage the starlight starter and Claude Code. The goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of Starlight in a clean environment.

- I started on this branch at 9:00 AM, 07/26/2025. It's written as much as possible with Claude Code and minimal human interaction. The goal is to show how quickly we can build a site from scratch using Starlight.
- I hit the Claude Code usage limit around noon. I also took a lunch break around 11 am.
