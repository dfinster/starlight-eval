# Starlight Evaluation

This repository is for evaluation and testing purposes only. It is not intended for production use.

Multiple demo branches are created from the `main` branch to experiment with different Starlight features and configurations. When a demo branch is ready for review, a pull request (PR) is opened. This allows us to track the associated Netlify deployment through the PR comments. After review, the PR is closed to keep the `main` branch organized.
